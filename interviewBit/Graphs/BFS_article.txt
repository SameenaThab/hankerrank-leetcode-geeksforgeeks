Basically the summary of the article is BFS is good for finding the shortest path but not cheapest path.


So for a weighted graph where BFS will end up finding the costly path

Example:

0--1--2--0 src:0 ,dest:2

cost(0,1) is 100
cost(0,2) is 500
cost(2,1) is 100

Cheapest path 0-1-2 = 200
Shortest path is 0-2 = 500

We can use BFS to find cheapest path where we keep updating the mincost array . 
Initially mincost[src] = 0 and mincost[all others] = infinity
mincost[neighbor] = Math.min(minCost[neighbor], minCost[popped element]+weight[popped element, neighbor]

But every time we find a mincost for a neighbor we add its neighbors back to queue to update its neighbors.

SO BFS is not good idea, never know when if we can stop finding and updating  mincost

But when number of hops is strictly constrained then we can use BFS. So find cheapest cost and also with in k hops. Then we can stop updating mincost hops exceed k.

BFS for min hops performs better than DFS (In article it said Dynamic programming, but I am assuming recursive DFS)
