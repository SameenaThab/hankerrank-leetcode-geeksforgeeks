Print the path of the of a file or folder from root
 
        folder1
          /  \
      Fol2   Fol3
      /       /  \
file1      file2  file3

path of file2 = foler1/fol2/file1

path of file3 = folder1/fol3/file3


solution used BFS same as finding shortest path from root to destination
But in queue I push Pair<TreeNode, string with PathTillNow >
