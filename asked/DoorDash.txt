Given an array of all unique items
Find the minimum item that is greater than its adjacent items
Then delete the item and add to the result list
Find all the items one by one until the all the array items are deleted

input [3,5,1,4,2]
output: [4,2,5,3,1]

Step 1: [3,5,1,4,2]  -> 5 and 4 are the peaks -> 4 is minimum peak
Step 2: delete 4 from array add 4 to the result = [4] arr = [3,5,1,2]
step 3: [3,5,1,2]  -> 5 and 2 are the peaks -> 2 is minimum peak
Step 4: delete 2 from array add 2 to the result = [4,2] arr = [3,5,1]
step 5: [3,5,1]  -> 5 is minimum peak
Step 6: delete 5 from array add 5 to the result = [4,2,5] arr = [3,1]
step 7: [3,1]  -> 3 is minimum peak
Step 8: delete 3 from array add 3 to the result = [4,2,5,3] arr = [1]
step 9: [1]  -> 1 is minimum peak
Step 10: delete 1 from array add 1 to the result = [4,2,5,3,1] arr = []
 --------->Stop since all items in arr are deleted<------------


 Approach: 
- Since for deletions arr will need to swap all other elements to the deleted number place 
- I went with double linked list Approach
- 3 <-> 5 <-> 1 <-> 4 <-> 2
- Construct doubledLinkedList from the arrya
- while(doubledLinkedList != null) {
    // find the minimum peak
    // Add minimum peak value to the result list
    // delete the minimum peak 
}
