delete kth node from last

given an array, find if contiguous sub arry exists thats sums to target

[1,3,1,4,23] target = 8 output= true [3,1,4]
[1,3,1,4,23] target = 7 output= false

Find all the subsets of a set
Scheduler:
    Given a MAp adjList, find all runnable tasks
    1 -> {2,3} // 2 and 3 can be completed only after 1
    2 -> {4}
    3 -> {}
    4 -> {}
    5 -> {2} // 2 can be complated only after 5
FindAllRunnableTasks -> {1,5}
CompleteTask -> 
SOlution I gave: create a map which stores for Each task make no of parent tasks 
    eg: 1 - 0
        2 - 2 depend on[1,5]
        3 - 1    // depend on 1
        4 - 1 depend on 2
        5 - 0
    find runnable task by finding task with 0 Count
    completeTask by removing  task from the count map and deducting all 1 from all its children after task1, task2 count becomes from 2 to 1
Add to binary string
check if treeNode.value = average of its descendents
given a sorted array, find the kth missing Number
