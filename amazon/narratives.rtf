Disagreed to reuse a existing method to check if unsubscribed. Since it needs partner param, And it calls all unwanted queries about city unsubscription and all.\

Created no response schedule reminder for renter to inform landlord has not responded.\
\
apply_now failed application alert email. Since this is our main source of income. I wanted the every failed apply now to be notified to tech team with reason. We made many changes based on this later on. Automated it so that marketing people does not have to ask us every time it failed\
\
Special case. Could  have dealt with one if clause. But I thought this would be a bandage fix. And in near future more such special case can rise. So I create different api for special case, there by eliminating front end logic. Made it reusable so that any new special cases can come in and tell front their requirements.\
\
Filter impure data coming from syndicated partners, so that we do not lose customers due to failed application. So I filtered leads and let renter know before process proceed and kind of steer the customer towards new agent with same zip code . There by no lose of customer and help agents make money.\

Unsubscription through email- disagreed with manager.\
\
Removed unnecessary listing to applications (one to many) relation to improve performance\

Used React components so that in future new co branded page can be easily created by reusable code\

I tried to test the whole workflow time to time. I recognized some renters were being ignored by new landlords. So created a threshold of how long to wait for landlords response.\

Good coding practices. Unit tests. Check every possible test case. Pull requests for any NPE.\

Our Marketing Team needs some special feature developed time to time on our platform. They are not always certain on their requirements. At times they make a request and change their mind after seeing the end product. We have a feature called apply now which can our users can unsubscribe.

1 We are developing a task where LL delegates responsibility of reviewing renter\'92s application to third person. Initially it was a two confirmation where reviewer will accept the request and then LL will confirm it . But then our stakeholders wanted it be a one way confirmation where reviewer has final say and he gets the authority. It is an easy to implement but I did not finish this change as it they were the was proposed before vacation and I did not want this to be in production without a them understanding the risk of giving the 3rd person so much authority.\

As part of new partner integration we were creating a new user role on the platform and this used had to be notified and new emails and reminders had to be set so this task was not clear whether I need to create new notifications for the user or change the existing notifications for the other roles. So I made sure during the scrum meetings on meeting them know that I am working on this task so that there is no overlap. Recently we had big partner integration.the tasks not completely fleshed out and also not assigned. We had a  general understanding of what to is the changes to be made. So one of the task was just notifications. So it meant to unschedule.\
Non working pormocode code already exists in the system (user referrer) they wanted to add the promo code used in the first mile email for analytics. Unclear between promo code and user referrals. Prmocode comes form sales force need to be part of payment, where as use referral need not be. Had to convey that to the manager, that there is already userefferels called promo codes. So had to separate them. Took responsibility. \

Information from our  partners in this scenario the applications were failing .we started filtering a listing with incomplete landlord information and matching interested renters with agents who can find them listings with similar features.\

This was a very successful because the search work for all columns. So if we type gmail all records with gmail as email will appear.\
Ans 3: No front end sorting and searching required for apply now output summary report. All back end handled and all search params all accepted.\

Use of singleton pattern:\

\f5\b0 For mail merge task, I had to create a bytstream for URL(payment template URL). For every call of payment receipt notification, this stream was being created. So I used singleton pattern Class with a map<URL,bryStream> so that only one time we convert URL to stream avoiding duplicate  read/write operations.\
\

\f6\b Best Use of unit test: Serialization Error in Quartz Scheduler run method.\

\f5\b0 [a]. I cannot always wait for the schedule time to come and check what is the error. Or decrease the schedule time locally and invoke run method. So I went thru the error stack trace and found out the serialization code that Quartz scheduler is using and created a unit test for that code. Turns out my object I was passing for job scheduling was locked because it was not out of entity yet.\
[b]. Payment Receipt template changes not being updating in the email because in AWS the template was cached and it takes 24hr to lad to new template to the cache. It is expensive to delete the cache( we have to create a invalidation). So I made unit tests use template from file system until I perfected the template , the way I want. This was a great learning experience as I wasted hours not knowing why my changes are not reflected.\
