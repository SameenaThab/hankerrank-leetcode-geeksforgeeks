Min Moves to Make String Without 3 Identical Consecutive Letters (from above list)

given an integer, you need to insert a digit '5' to get a largest possible number. (ex: 93 ->953, -76 -> -576)
1 debugging question(it was easy)

Couple of tricky questions in MCQ:

how many comparison you have on 5 element array to find minimum value? 4 times

Given a list of 1000 elements which of the following numbers is the largest? (all of them)

-The time complexity of g(n, x, y) is O(n). What is the time complexity of f(n)? O(nlogN)
def f(n):
if n == 1:
return 1
x = f(n/2)
y = f (n/2)
return g(n,x,y)

-which of the following algorithm finds the shortest path in any unweighted graph? BFS
-You are given an array with 10^8 elements and you must compute the sum A[j]+A[k] for every possible pair of elements in the array. How long will this computation take on a single mainstream computer? (milliseconds, seconds, hours, or a few hours) not sure what this answer is
We have 10^8 elements and we need to compute the sum with O(N^2) complexity, then the required operation count is 10^16.
Modern common server's CPU clock speed is around 4GHz/s, then we can assume the summation is only an atomic cpu instruction. So, a CPU can handle 4^9/s, then the operation count / CPU clock is the answer.
1 GHz = 1billion = 10^9
Answer: 10^16 / 4*10^9 -> 2,500,000 second, ->28.9 days.
